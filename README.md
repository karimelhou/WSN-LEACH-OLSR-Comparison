# WSN-LEACH-OLSR-Comparison
This repository contains the research paper, data analysis scripts for comparing the performance of LEACH and OLSR routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with respect to energy consumption and packet delivery ratio under various node mobility scenarios.

## Performance Evaluation of OLSR and LEACH Routing Protocols in Terms of Energy Consumption under Varying Node Mobility: A NS2 Simulation Study.
Author, ELHoumaini Karim, FSTT

This is a research project that investigates the performance of two routing protocols, OLSR and LEACH, in terms of energy consumption with respect to node mobility in mobile ad hoc networks. The aim of the project is to identify the most energy-efficient routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks and provide valuable insights for network designers and researchers to develop more energy-efficient routing protocols.
